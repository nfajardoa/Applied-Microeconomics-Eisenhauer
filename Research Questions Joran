RQ 1:
Does returns to schooling differ for immigrants vs native Germans?

Based on Keane & Wolpin (1997) combined with Constant & Zimmermann (2003).
We will expand on K&W in the sense that we won't use white males but differentiate between sex and native Germans and (first/second generation) immigrants to Germany.

Hypotheses:
- Being native German will lead to "better" occupational choice, keeping constant years of education (due to racism, assimilation, network)
- Non-Western immigrants have lower returns to education compared to Western immigrants (due to quality of education, recognition of diploma)
- Males will have higher returns to education compared to females, keeping constant immigrant-status

Problems:
- Years of education does not say much if quality of education is different
- Countries have different educational systems (e.g. high school average graduation age 16 compared to 19)

Possible expansions:
- Parent's education level
- (For immigrants) where most years of education were followed (Germany or abroad)
- If trained for this specific job or not (overqualified)
