2. THE PRODUCTION OF HUMAN CAPITAL AND THE LIFE CYCLE OF EARNINGS by Yoram Ben-Porath\
This paper tries to deal with the argument that "people tend to invest themselves while still young because they will have longer period over which they can receive returns on the investment" by combining the demand for human capital facing the individual. It also claims that according to the basic model, the life cycle of earnings is hump-shaped, but the real situation somehow deviates a bit from the model. Therefore, using earnings to infer changes in productvity capacity is biased.\

3. Earnings Over the Lifecycle: The Mincer Earnings Function and Its Applications by IZA (There are about 100pages)\ 
This paper includes some other parameters that we could potentially use to set up our model. It discuss how earning pattens may differ between genders, races or even married and single. The earnings function which this paper cites is the classical one. It follows that the conclusion is also consistent with the findings in some other literatures, i.e. men tend to earn more than women and earning patterns follows a diminishing returns structure. The paper also claims that earning patterns are different between those who work continuously and discoutinuously.\

5. Life Cycle Wage Growth across Countries by David Lagakos
This paper concludes that experience-wage profiles are on average twice as steep in rich countries as in poor countries. Not so useful if we are about to use only German dataset. However, it also concludes that more educated workers have steeper earning profiles than less educated workers, which is consistent with most of the literatures.
