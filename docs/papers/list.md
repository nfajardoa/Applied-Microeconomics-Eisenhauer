List of papers for review!

1. THE DETERMINATION OF LIFE CYCLE EARNINGS: A SURVEY by Weiss\
An interesting paper which takes "aging" and "depreciation" into considerration. Claiming that the earning profile is increasing in the early ages and is declining towards the end of the working period. Especially, the paper also includes a "Gender" parameter. It claims that given the same working experiece, earnings growth tends to be lower for women.\

2. THE PRODUCTION OF HUMAN CAPITAL AND THE LIFE CYCLE OF EARNINGS by Yoram Ben-Porath\
This paper tries to deal with the argument that "people tend to invest themselves while still young because they will have longer period over which they can receive returns on the investment" by combining the demand for human capital facing the individual. It also claims that according to the basic model, the life cycle of earnings is hump-shaped, but the real situation somehow deviates a bit from the model. Therefore, using earnings to infer changes in productvity capacity is biased.\

3. Earnings Over the Lifecycle: The Mincer Earnings Function and Its Applications by IZA (There are about 100pages)\ 
This paper includes some other parameters that we could potentially use to set up our model. It discuss how earning pattens may differ between genders, races or even married and single. The earnings function which this paper cites is the classical one. It follows that the conclusion is also consistent with the findings in some other literatures, i.e. men tend to earn more than women and earning patterns follows a diminishing returns structure. The paper also claims that earning patterns are different between those who work continuously and discoutinuously.\

4. Human Capital Development: New Evidence on the Production of Socio-Emotional Skills by IZA\
This paper focuses on estimating the flexible skills production functions between the ages of 8 and 22. In this paper, socio-emotional skills is separated into two distinct domains. This could be a potential reerence paper if we are about to ocus on cognitive and non-cognitive productivity.\

5. Life Cycle Wage Growth across Countries by David Lagakos\
This paper concludes that experience-wage profiles are on average twice as steep in rich countries as in poor countries. Not so useful if we are about to use only German dataset. However, it also concludes that more educated workers have steeper earning profiles than less educated workers, which is consistent with most of the literatures. \

6. THE EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE AND NONCOGNITIVE ABILITIES ON LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR by James J. Heckman\
The paper introduces a new method to analyze the effects of cognitive and non-cognitive stills on wages, employment, schooling and behavioral outcomes. It shows that a model with one latent cognitive skill and one latent noncognitive skill explains a large array of diverse behaviors. Especially, there are also differences between genders in the effects of the skills. A very important argument of this paper is that, non-cognitive ability is as important, if not more important, than cognitive ability. This finding somehow contradicts the traditional view of most of the psychology literatures.\

7. ESTIMATING MARGINAL RETURNS TO EDUCATION by James J. Heckman\
This paper focuses on analyzing the effect of marginal policy change on the returns of schooling(college). It argues that the marginal return for going to college is not the same between individuals. The data suggests that self-selection on gains is an empirically important phenomenon governing schooling choices. It claims also that there is diminishing returns to education for additional students.\

8. (MIS-)PREDICTED SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING FOLLOWING LIFE EVENTS by Odermatt and Stutzer (2019)\
Uses SOEP data to see how people predict their future well-being after major life events (widowhood, unemployment, disability, marriage, separation, divorce). Actual topic at hand not really related to our research. Only take-away for us might be that people view their current and also five-year future utility exaggerated, so we might have to control for people experiencing these major life events in HS/college (e.g. if one experiences the death of a loved one in college they might drop out and not pursue their actual planned career path).\

9. Heterogeneous Returns to Personality – The Role of Occupational Choice by John and Thomsen (2012)\
Also uses SOEP data (1992-2009) to analyze the role of personality in occupational choices and wages. 1. To what extent does personality explain sorting into occupations, 2. Do differences in personality lead to wage differentials within occupations (less relevant to us). For personality (non-cognitive skills) they use 7 measures: reciprocity, locus of control, and big five personality traits. For cognitive skills they use the occupational groups (distinct w.r.t. education and tasks) and assume everyone in the same occupatioanl group has the same cognitive skills. They find that occupational sorting is influenced by all non-cognitive skills, they also confirm the hypothesis of a different valuation of non-cognitive skills across occupations. I think it's a pretty relevant paper to our study, especially the "first" part.\

10. Risky Business – The Role of Individual Risk Attitudes in Occupational Choice by Isphording (2010)\
Analyzes relationship of individual risk attitudes and occupational sorting w.r.t. occupational earnings risk (also with SOEP data). However, the significant relationship in cross-sectional analyses vanishes when controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. The results seem to be driven by correlation of unobserved ability and willingness to take risks. Take-away: importance of controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and instability of attitudes when examing the effects of personality traits in labor market decisions.\
--
11. Occupational Choice Across Generations by Zimmermann (2003)\
Paper from IZA, specificially focuses on intergenerational occ. choices, also based on SOEP data. Gender and education determine job ranking.\
--
12. Income comparisons and non-cognitive skills by Budria and Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2012)\
Mostly useful I guess for the non-cognitive skill definition. They find that people who are more neurotic, extravert and have low external locus of ocntrol and low negative reciprocity are more sensitvie to their individual position in the economic ladder -> might also be a explanation for some part of the occupational choice!\
