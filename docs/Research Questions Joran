RQ 1:
Does returns to schooling differ for immigrants vs native Germans?

Based on Keane & Wolpin (1997) combined with Constant & Zimmermann (2003) and Basilio et al. (2017).
We will expand on K&W in the sense that we won't use white males but differentiate between sex and native Germans and (first/second generation) immigrants to Germany.

Hypotheses:
- Being native German will lead to "better" occupational choice, keeping constant years of education (due to racism, assimilation, network)
- Non-Western immigrants have lower returns to education compared to Western immigrants (due to quality of education, recognition of diploma)
- Males will have higher returns to education compared to females, keeping constant immigrant-status

Problems:
- Years of education does not say much if quality of education is different
- Countries have different educational systems (e.g. high school average graduation age 16 compared to 19)

Possible expansions:
- Parent's education level
- (For immigrants) where most years of education were followed (Germany or abroad)
- If trained for this specific job or not (overqualified)

  Education and, in particular, labor market experience accumulated in the home countries of the immigrants receive significantly lower returns than human capital obtained in Germany.
  Further find evidence for heterogeneity in the returns to human capital of immigrants across countries. Imperfect human capital transferability appears to be a major factor in explaining the wage differential between natives and immigrants.
